Run with the following params

./bsperf <port> <nthreads> <nqueues> <njobs>

This will create nqueues and insert njobs into those queues using nthreads 
After inserting all jobs they'll be reserved and deleted.
Use njobs as a multiple of nthreads and nqueues (nqueues should be a multiple of nthreads).

Example:

./bsperf 11300 20 500 1000000
